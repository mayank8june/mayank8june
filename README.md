## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mayank
I'm a software engineer with experience at Intel and Tesco Media (Dunnhumby), specializing in backend systems, scalable infrastructure, and innovative tooling. I build things that blend creativity with technical depth â€” from real-time engines to backend platforms and podcasts.
